## History

This documentation was initiated by [Adam Twardoch](https://github.com/twardoch) as a community contributor in 2015, and updated by [Dave Crossland](https://github.com/davelab6) as a member of the Google Fonts team in 2020. It is provided so that other font distributors (webfonts providers or font package maintainers) can better use the library repo repository structure.

This metadata is specifically used by Google Fonts for organization and display on the Google Fonts website. It may be useful for others to be able to make sense of the metadata files.

## Generation

The file can be partially generated by the `gftools add-font` script and [gftools packager](https://github.com/googlefonts/gftools/tree/main/docs/gftools-packager):

``` code
gftools add-font path/to/google/fonts/ofl/fontdirname
```

The file uses [UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoding.

Below are two examples of `METADATA.pb` files, first for a family of static font files, and then for a family with variable font files, followed by a brief description of each key and possible values.

## Description of Keys

Most top-level keys provide unique information which is generally not derived from or matching with data inside the font files themselves. Each top-level field can only occur once in the file. The order of the keys does not strictly matter, but the order in this example is typical and is maintained when possible to avoid noisy diff comparisons.

### name

Family name used to call the family's fonts from the Google Fonts API, and shown in the catalog [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/).

Example: `name: "Playpen Sans"`

### date_added

Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format that the font was added to Google Fonts. It is used to order the front page of the [GF catalog](https://fonts.google.com/), both obviously the "date added" sort mode, and also the default "trending mode."

Once pushed to production, updating this date is generally not allowed, although exceptions can be made in limited cases.

Example: `date_added: "2021-09-30"`

### designer

The full name of the type designers or foundries who designed the fonts. The order in which the names are listed here will determine the order of appareance in the About section in the font specimen page. (See below.) 
Each designer listed needs to have an entry in the library repo [/catalog/designers](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/catalog/designers) tree; and each one needs to match a string in the `designer` key of `info.pb` files there.

Examples:

-   `designer: "Principal Designer, Contributor, Contributor"` — In 2016 the catalog UI added a feature to show several named contributors on each font family 'About' section of the specimen page, where the value of this key is a comma separated list, and the first item in the list is shown the credit "Principal Design". See the following examples: [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik), [Castoro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Castoro), [Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico)
-   `designer: "Anja Meiners"` — An individual's name is preferred; typically there is an individual who is the principle designer of the typeface family, even if they are no longer the primary maintainer of the project
-   `designer: "TypeTogether"` — Sometimes, a formal organization designs a family and occupies the principal designer position. Then, the individual name of the credited designer is followed.
-   `designer: "Huerta Tipográfica"` — Non-ascii characters are supported as UTF-8

### license

Declares the license of the fonts in the family. It can contain one of 3 possible values, although all the new fonts added are expected to be licensed by OFL:

-   `license: "APACHE2"`
-   `license: "OFL"`
-   `license: "UFL"`

### category

Typographic classifications, one of 5 possible values:

-   `category: "SERIF"`
-   `category: "SANS_SERIF"`
-   `category: "DISPLAY"`
-   `category: "HANDWRITING"`
-   `category: "MONOSPACE"`

In 2023, the `category` field was complemented with two new fields called `stroke` and `classifications`. The `category` field will continue to exist with no changes to its semantics. We are keeping this field as is because Google products like Workspace and Ads use it, and we don't want to affect those products.

This key is deprecated in the API (cf. below Stroke and Classification), but still mandatory to fill up in METADATA.pb

### fonts

Dictionaries with information specific to each font file in the family. The values in this section typically match those inside the font files. Example:

``` code
fonts {
  name: "Playpen Sans"
  style: "normal"
  weight: 400
  filename: "PlaypenSans[wght].ttf"
  post_script_name: "PlaypenSans-Regular"
  full_name: "Playpen Sans Regular"
  copyright: "Copyright 2023 The Playpen Sans Project Authors (https://github.com/TypeTogether/Playpen-Sans)"
}
```

#### fonts — name

Family name used to call the font from the Google Fonts API. This must match the `name` key used at the top level.
This typically matches the font file's [`name table`](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/name.htm) ID 16, or if that does not exist, the ID 1. If multiple ID 16s or 1s exist, they must match.

Example: `name: "Playpen Sans"`

#### fonts — style

Value of the CSS `font-style` property served by Google Fonts. One of 2 possible values:

-   `style: "normal"`
-   `style: "italic"`

Styles marked as `normal` in the family METADATA file refers to any upright styles, and `italic` refers to any [style-linked](./statics#style-linking) italic styles.

#### fonts — weight

Value of the CSS `font-weight` property served by Google Fonts. For families offered as static fonts, this will be one of 9 possible values:

-   `"weight": 100`
-   `"weight": 200`
-   `"weight": 300`
-   `"weight": 400`
-   `"weight": 500`
-   `"weight": 600`
-   `"weight": 700`
-   `"weight": 800`
-   `"weight": 900`

Typically this matches the value of `usWeightClass` in the font file's [`OS/2`](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm) table.

For variable fonts, this will be one of the 9 possible values that corresponds to the `glyf` table outline design.

#### fonts — filename

The font filename. Example: `"filename": "PlaypenSans[wght].ttf"`

There is a "canonical" naming scheme for font filenames in the Google Fonts library.

For static fonts the pattern is `$family-$style.ttf` and the allowed values are as follows; These filenames are case sensitive, unlike the default file system of macOS, so `Semibold` is not allowed, and simply renaming it in macOS Finder will not be effective; it needs to be renamed to something with one more/less character, then renamed back to a correct name.

-   `ExampleSans-Thin.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-ThinItalic.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-ExtraLight.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-ExtraLightItalic.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-Light.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-LightItalic.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-Regular.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-Italic.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-Medium.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-MediumItalic.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-SemiBold.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-SemiBoldItalic.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-Bold.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-BoldItalic.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-ExtraBold.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-ExtraBoldItalic.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-Black.ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-BlackItalic.ttf`

For variable fonts, the naming scheme is the family name, then an alphabetically sorted, comma separated, list of axes within square brackets. If the family has Italic styles in a second file, then the `-Italic` particle is appended to the family name.

-   `ExampleSans[wdth,wght].ttf`
-   `ExampleSans-Italic[wdth,wght].ttf`

#### fonts — post_script_name

Value of the font file's [`name table`](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/name.htm) ID 6. If multiple ID 6s exist, they must match. Example: `post_script_name: "PlaypenSans-Regular"`

Typically this matches the stem of the `filename`.

#### fonts — full_name

Value of the font file's [`name`](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/name.htm) table ID 4. If multiple ID 4s exist, they must match. Example: `full_name: "Playpen Sans Regular"`

#### fonts — copyright

Copyright notice. Example: `copyright: "Copyright 2023 The Playpen Sans Project Authors (https://github.com/TypeTogether/Playpen-Sans)"`

Typically this matches the value of the copyright notice in the first lines of the license file. It also matches the font file [`name table`](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/name.htm) ID 0. If multiple ID 0s exist, they must match.

### subsets

List of all character subsets available in Google Fonts API for the given font family. They are described as languages, but they are actually script sets.

These subsets are defined in [GF Subsets repo](https://github.com/googlefonts/nam-files/tree/main/Lib/gfsubsets/data) (with the exception of the `menu` subset). 

The `menu` subset is the characters of the font family name (defined above) and is used in font picker UIs to render the font name in itself. This subset is mandatory for all fonts.

**The subsets must be sorted in alphabetical order**. The possible values are the same as the available `nam` files. For example, if a `nam` file is named `chorasmian_unique-glyphs.nam` the key in `METADATA.pb` would be `subsets: "chorasmian"` (the `nam` file path without "_unique-glyphs.nam")

### primary script

This key aims to indicate which script the specimen page on Google Fonts should display in priority.
The possible values to enter here must refer to the **ID** of the specified script's textprotos from the [lang directory](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/lang/Lib/gflanguages/data/scripts) in `google/fonts` repo.

Example:

```code
primary_script: "Arab"
```

### Languages

This key aims to restrict the number of languages shown in a specimen page. It is mandatory in all Noto fonts but not recommended in non-Nono fonts. It can be useful though when a font support the glyphs of a specific language only.

Example:

```code
languages: "gu_Gujr"  # Gujarati
```

### registry_default_overrides

Override the default value from the Axis Registry. This is required when axis min and max values do not match the registry default, or when the default value differs from the registered default for the axis.

Repeated for each axis.

Contains 2 required child values:

-   `key`, with a string value for the 4 character axis tag code.
-   `value`, as `int` or `float` values.

Example:

``` code
registry_default_overrides {
  key: "opsz"
  value: 18
}
```

→ Look at [Roboto Flex](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/main/ofl/robotoflex/METADATA.pb) for an example of complex Axis Registry override:

### source

Indicates the upstream repo URL, files location and the commit at which the font was taken, this important for versioning, but also to keep a trace back the origin of the font since multiple forks can exist for one project.

If the source is a *tagged release*, then the source entry should look like this:

``` code
source {
repository_url: "https://github.com/username/projectname"
archive_url: "https://github.com/username/projectname/releases/download/v2.200/projectname-2.200.zip"
}
```
### display_name

The `display_name` key is used when the font name should appear differently on the API. The main use of this key is for families which have abbreviated names as a convention, for example the Noto CJK. This is not necessarily clear for the user, so the `display_name` key is used to display an unabbreviated name on the specimen page.

Example:
```code
font_name: "Noto Sans JP"
display_name: "Noto Sans Japanese"
```

Another example of use of this key is when the font family name should be written with an hyphen. Indeed, the hyphen is only authorized to separate the family name from the style name; having a font family name with an hyphen would cause a bad file path and postscript name.

Example:

```code
font_name: "Noto Sans PhagsPa"
display_name: "Noto Sans Phags-pa"
```

### minisite_url

This key allows to link a mini website to the font's specimen page. It will appear on top of the page, under the font name, next to the designer's name. A minisite_url is expected to be mandatory for all the commisioned fonts.

Example:

``` code
minisite_url: "https://myfontwebsite.com"
```


### classification

The classification field is a complementary field that can be any combination of Handwriting, Display, Monospace, or Symbols, or it can not be set. So for example, if a font is Handwriting, Display and Monospace all at the same time, use all three. If it does not fit into any of those classifications, there is no need to use the field.

-   `classifications: "HANDWRITING"`
-   `classifications: "DISPLAY"`
-   `classifications: "MONOSPACE"`
-   `classifications: "SYMBOLS"`

### stroke

The stroke field has a single value that is one of `SANS_SERIF`, `SERIF`, `SLAB_SERIF`. It should always be set if one of those options accurately describes the design since some features in the UI only look at the stroke value for some things. Otherwise, if one of the options doesn't describe the design, it can not be set. Google Fonts Search UI will present `stroke` and `classifications` as separate search groups so users can combine them and search, say, for fonts that are Serif and Display.

-   `stroke: "SANS_SERIF"`
-   `stroke: "SERIF"`
-   `stroke: "SLAB_SERIF"`

### sample_text

This key overrides the sample texts provided in the languages texprotos (that you can find in the [Lang](https://github.com/googlefonts/lang/tree/main/Lib/gflanguages/data/languages) repository). Therefore, the properties of these keys are the same as the ones in a lang textproto. Use it sparingly only for edge cases that would definitely need to specify a determined sample since this override will make this sample fixed, disabling the possibility of picking different languages on the type-tester section of the Specimen page. 

If sample text is given within a sample text group (e.g. poster, specimen, masthead), all fields within that group must be provided.

- `masthead_full` is a 4 glyphs string (e.g. AaBb) used in a single-script masthead. It is used in specimen masthead component.
- `masthead_partial` is a 2 glyphs string (e.g. Aa) that contributes in building a multi-script masthead. It is used in specimen masthead component.
- `styles` is a phrase that has 40-60 chars. Used in presenting the font in different styles in specimen styles component.
- `tester` is a phrase that has 60-90 chars. It is used in presenting the font in GF catalog specimen type tester component.

Poster samples are used in presenting the font in GF catalog specimen poster component. The poster module has 3 different strings shown in 3 different styles. A `sm`, `md`, and `lg` string is needed for each of the three rows in the poster. The poster group is only used in Noto fonts.

- `poster_sm` is a phrase that has 10-15 chars.
- `poster_md` is a phrase that has 8-12 chars.
- `poster_lg` is a word that has 3-8 chars.

Specimen samples are used as type ramp samples. The <nn> indicates the rendering size.

- `specimen_48` is a sentence that has 60-70 chars.
- `specimen_36` is a paragraph that has 100-120 chars.
- `specimen_32` is a paragraph that has 140-180 chars.
- `specimen_21` is a passage that has 300-500 chars.
- `specimen_16` is a passage that has 550-750 chars.

Example:

```code
sample_text {
  masthead_full: "ᜀᜅᜎᜑ"
  masthead_partial: "ᜆᜂ"
  styles: "ᜀᜅ᜔ ᜎᜑᜆ᜔ ᜅ᜔ ᜆᜂᜌ᜔ ᜁᜐᜒᜈᜒᜎᜅ᜔ ᜈ ᜋᜎᜌ ᜀᜆ᜔ ᜉᜈ᜔ᜆᜌ᜔ᜉᜈ᜔ᜆᜌ᜔ ᜐ ᜃᜇᜅᜎᜈ᜔"

### Ordered sample glyphs

This key overrides the Glyphs page on the UI. Example: [Noto Emoji](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Emoji/glyphs). Not recommended to use in other fonts than icon/symbols one.

Example:

```code
ordered_sample_glyphs {
  name: "Smileys and emotions"
  glyphs: "😀 😃 😄 😁 😆 😅 😂 🤣 😭 😉 😗 😙 😚 😘 🥰 😍 🤩 🥳 🙃 🙂 🥲 🥹 😋 😛 😝 😜 🤪 😇 😊 ☺️ 😏 😌 😔 😑 😐 😶 🫡 🤔 🤫 🫢 🤭 🥱 🤗 🫣 😱 🤨 🧐 😒 🙄 😮‍💨 😤 😠 😡 🤬 🥺 😟 😥 😢 ☹️ 🙁 🫤 😕 🤐 😰 😨 😧 😦 😮 😯 😲 😳 🤯 😬 😓 😞 😖 😣 😩 😫 😵 😵‍💫 🙂‍↔️ 🙂‍↕️ 🫥 😴 😪 🤤 🌛 🌜 🌚 🌝 🌞 🫠 😶‍🌫️ 🥴 🥵 🥶 🤢 🤮 🤧 🤒 🤕 😷 🤠 🤑 😎 🤓 🥸 🤥 🤡 👻 💩 👽 🤖 🎃 😈 👿 👹 👺 🔥 💫 ⭐ 🌟 ✨ 💥 💯 💢 💨 💦 🫧 💤 🕳️ 🎉 🎊 🙈 🙉 🙊 😺 😸 😹 😻 😼 😽 🙀 😿 😾 ❤️ 🧡 💛 💚 💙 💜 🤎 🖤 🤍 ♥️ 💘 💝 💖 💗 💓 💞 💕 💌 💟 ❣️ ❤️‍🩹 💔 ❤️‍🔥 💋 🫂 👥 👤 🗣️ 👣 🧠 🫀 🫁 🩸 🦠 🦷 🦴 ☠️ 💀 👀 👁️ 👄 🫦 👅 👃 👂 🦻 🦶 🦵 🦿 🦾 💪 👍 👎 👏 🫶 🙌 👐 🤲 🤝 🤜 🤛 ✊ 👊 🫳 🫴 🫱 🫲 🤚 👋 🖐️ ✋ 🖖 🤟 🤘 ✌️ 🤞 🫰 🤙 🤌 🤏 👌 🖕 ☝️ 👆 👇 👉 👈 🫵 ✍️ 🤳 🙏 💅"
