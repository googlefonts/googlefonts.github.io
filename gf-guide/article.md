# Article and Description files
{:.no_toc}

<div class="callout">

🦉 Both the <mark class="grey">ARTICLE.en_us.html</mark> and <mark class="grey">DESCRIPTION.en_us.html</mark> files are used to bring the information that appears in the <code>#About</code> section on any specimen page of <a href="https://fonts.google.com">Google Fonts</a> to provide further information about the font family.
<br><br>
The team member onboarding the font will create any of these files. Thus, the actual file a designer should write carefully is the <a href="./readmefile">README.md</a> file of the font's repository, as the information in it will be crucial to create a descriptive <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kalnia#about">#About</a> section.

## The Article

The Article file is a new expanded version of the `DESCRIPTION.en_us.html` file that includes images and longer-form information and content. It appears on the Google Fonts site as the main content in the About & License section. For example, see the About page of [Playpen Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playpen+Sans/about), and then view the `ofl/playpensans` directory in the Google Fonts repo: [github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/playpensans](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/ofl/playpensans). 

The `ARTICLE.en_us.html` file and images should live in an `article/` directory alongside the `METADATA.pb` file in the root of the `ofl/fontname` directory. Typically, only the Noto fonts are expected to combine the `DESCRIPTION.en_us.html` and `ARTICLE.en_us.html` files. For all the other families (non-Noto), if an article with images is added, the description should be overwritten by the Article. This means that, in the case of adding expanded content and images, we should shift all the Description content to the Article and delete the `DESCRIPTION.en_us.html`.

Here are some guidelines for how to prepare the `article/` directory and files:

### Requirements

- **Pay attention to the content.** Feel free to write a comprehensive text that will pay tribute to your project. Here are added examples of 'About' sections on Google Fonts. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ojuju/about"> Ojuju</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Flex/about"> Roboto Flex</a>.
- **Should be written in the third person.**
- **Copywriting should not be inappropriate, stereotypical, or offensive.** For example, "This family demonstrates a feminine energy with its fragile aspect" is unacceptable.
- **The text length** should be around 500 words, and more than 100 characters.
- **If the font is derived from another font,** it should mention the original with a URL to the font on GF if it exists.
- **All links in it must be properly working.**
- **Should not contain biography information.** This bio info should go in the [designer's credits](./profile). We accept credits if they are not mentioned in the credit section (for example, help on development, specific names of people involved if only a collective name is credited, etc.).
- **It must include a hypertext link to the upstream repository.** That is the designer’s GitHub repository. This line of text usually goes at the end of the first paragraph, before the line that separates it from the added text when the article has a long text. 
<br>
You can copy/paste the following line (don’t forget to adjust the URL):

    ``` code
    To contribute, see <a href="https://github.com/owner/fontname">github.com/owner/fontname</a>
    ```

-   **The text should be updated when the font is upgraded** to let people know what changed.

    <span style="border-bottom:0.05em solid">Example:</span>

    > This font was upgraded in July 2021 to expand its language coverage. It now supports Greek and Cyrillic.
-   **We only accept** **`.en_us`** **extension**, but you can definitely add a translation to the description when the font primarily targets an audience reading a non-latin script.
-   If the primary script of your font is not Latin, we strongly recommend you also provide a translation of the text using the actual main script. **This localised text must be in the same html snippet as the English text.**

### Format text with the font family

You may format text with the font family by using HTML span tags with the `"autonym"` class. This should not be used to style the entire document. Use it sparingly to document available features in the font family. For example, to style the text "THIS TEXT" with the font family, enter HTML like this:

```html
<span class="autonym">THIS TEXT</span>
```

### Images

Please refer to the [Promote your font](./promotion.md) section of this Guide for fully detailed information on these images. The following summarizes the main specifications for the required images.

- Supported image formats: JPG, PNG, SVG, but there is a strong preference for JPG/SVG. JPEGs are optimized so that lower resolution images will be downloaded on smaller viewport sizes.
- Max image size for SVG is 800 KB; for other formats, it is 1.75 MB (enforced by knowledge_graph.py GitHub workflow)
The recommended width is at least 1000px. You don't need any particular proportions; the container will resize the image.
- Resolution: 72dpi.

#### Videos

There are two options to include videos in the Article file: `MP4` with a max file size of 1.4 MB; and a `YouTube` link.

- For the `MP4` video inclusion, it must follow this format:

   `<video autoplay muted src="your-video-name.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>`
   
   or, if you need to loop it:
   
   `<video loop autoplay muted src="video1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>`

   You can see these cases as reference: <a href="https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/main/ofl/danfo/article/ARTICLE.en_us.html">Danfo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/main/ofl/savate/article/ARTICLE.en_us.html">Savate</a> 


- For the `YouTube` link, this option requires a cover image to display as preview, and must follow the following format:

   `<a href="https://youtu.be/videoIDnumber>"><img src="your-cover-image.png" /></a>`

   `<p><em><a href="https://youtu.be/videoIDnumber">Watch the introduction video on YouTube</a></em</p>`


### Allowed HTML elements

-  `<a>`, `<blockquote>`, `<code>`, `<em>`, `<figcaption>`, `<figure>`, `<hr>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<img>`, `<li>`, `<p>`, `<pre>`, `<span>`, `<strong>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<sub>`
- The Article file can also include `<img>` and `<video>`

### Forbidden HTML elements
 
- `<applet>`, `<base>`, `<embed>`, `<form>`, `<frame>`, `<frameset>`, `<head>`, `<iframe>`, `<link>`, `<math>`, `<meta>`, `<object>`, `<script>`, `<style>`, `<svg>`, `<template>`
- The Description file can't include `<img>` and `<video>`
- **Other HTML elements are generally not allowed** either, and the catalog web app will remove them.

## Examples

### Without localised text

See [Space+Grotesk#about](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Grotesk?query=Space+Grotesk#about) provided by [DESCRIPTION.en_us.html](https://github.com/floriankarsten/space-grotesk/blob/master/DESCRIPTION.en_us.html) as an example: it gives plenty of links (mini-website, original authors, referenced font published in GF), and follows all requirements.


### With localised text

See [Zen+Antique#about](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Zen+Antique#about) as an example, provided by this file [DESCRIPTION.en_us.html](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/main/ofl/zenantique/DESCRIPTION.en_us.html).

**Html snippet**

``` code
<p>Zen Antique features two kinds of Antique Japanese with Kanji.
The impression of the weights (thickness) of strokes are different among characters—Hiragana and Latin alphabets are slightly lighter, 
while Katakana and Kanji are slightly heavier, which gives the unique rhythm and taste in this font.
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Zen+Antique+Soft">Zen Antique Soft</a> has a slightly rounded effect on the corners.</p>

<p>Zen Antique には、古風な雰囲気の二種類の漢字を含む日本語書体があります。
文字によって画線の太さに変化があり、ひらがなと欧文は細め、カタカナと漢字は太めで、フォントに独特のリズムと味わいを与えています。

## The Description

This file follows the same requirements as the Article file with some exceptions:

- The content might be more succinct.
- It can't include images, so the HTML elements `<img>` and `video` are not allowed.

However, please bear in mind that following our new efforts to promote the fonts, the Description file is considered legacy.
