# Authors and Contributors
{:.no_toc}

<div class="callout">

ü¶§ Authors and contributors are people or organizations participating in a project, either because they are the people who made it, the people who paid for it, or the employers who gathered the people who made it.

* The list of authors is for the copyright holders. Typically this is the creators, or the organization employing the actual creators, or the client of that organization. It is best to confirm for yourself who holds copyrights in a project, as it is often not a simple single answer.
* The list of contributors is for everyone who participated in the project (creators, producers, engineers, developers, writers, etc) and explicitly includes non‚Äìcopyright-holders.

Google Fonts prefers to credit human designers whereever possible, alongside foundry and client brands.

## Crediting authors

The <mark class="grey">AUTHORS.txt</mark> file is mandatory for font projects published in Google Fonts:

* The <mark class="grey">AUTHORS.txt</mark> file is important legally: The copyright string in the License file references this file. No modification can be made to the license, unless all copyright holders agreed to it, so it is important to have a convenient way to know who those copyright holders are.
* Google Fonts uses the <mark class="grey">AUTHORS.txt</mark> file along with other information (like the <mark class="grey">CONTRIBUTORS.txt</mark> file) to know who to credit in the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Brygada+1918#about">#About section</a> of the specimen page.

In the jargon of copyright law, a copyright-holder is an author, even if they were not the physical author of the work.
Often an organization is the only copyright-holder, because the designers and contributors all signed contracts transferring all rights to that organization.
In these cases, the names of the individual creators and contributors should be listed in the CONTRIBUTORS.txt file.

You can find a template for your <mark class="grey">AUTHORS.txt</mark> file in the [Google Fonts Project Template](https://github.com/googlefonts/googlefonts-project-template), or copy-paste the text below into a `.txt` file that you add at the root of your repository. Don‚Äôt forget to replace our example ‚ÄúSupercompany‚Äù and ‚ÄúLaura Artist‚Äù by the actual copyright holders of the project.

```code
# This is the official list of project authors for copyright purposes.
# This file is distinct from the CONTRIBUTORS.txt file.
# See the latter for an explanation.
#
# Names should be added to this file as:
# Name or Organization <email address

Super Company <info@supercompany.com>
Laura Artist <mail@lauraartist.com>
```

## Crediting contributors

The CONTRIBUTORS.txt file is used to acknowledge the participation of all human contributors, and may be used to reach out to some people when necessary (such as to ask a specific technical question of the font engineer).

You can also find a template for this file in the [Google Fonts Project Template](https://github.com/googlefonts/googlefonts-project-template/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.txt), or copy-paste the text below into a `.txt` file that you add at the root of your repository. Don‚Äôt forget to replace our example ‚ÄúBob Tester‚Äù and ‚ÄúMaggie Techno‚Äù with the actual contributors to the project.

``` code
# This is the list of people who have contributed to this project,
# and includes those not listed in AUTHORS.txt because they are not
# copyright authors. For example, company employees may be listed
# here because their company holds the copyright and is listed there.
#
# When adding J Random Contributor's name to this file, either J's
# name or J's organization's name should be added to `AUTHORS.txt`
#
# Names should be added to this file as:
# Name <email address

Bob Tester <hello@bobtester.com>
Maggie Techno <maggietechno@company.com>
```
